# Custom_SEM_InteractionMenu

*Multi Purpose FiveM Interaction Menu Customized*

This resource is a menu with actions for LEO, Fire, Civ including Vehicle Controls, Emotes and a Priority Status!

Each section has features that would be used by each of the professions, for example the LEO Menu has Cuff, Drag, Seat, etc.
The Settings Menu is in WIP. The Priority Status function sort of works, When you start the priority, It will show the first person on the Playerlist (Don't know how to fix).
I have re-arranged the Submenu's, Deleted the unassesery submenus, Fixed the Shield (So you can hold a gun and shoot.), I have also added Arrows to the right of the menus.

SEM_InteractionMenu was made by Scott1 using NativeUI [LUA] | This version was customized by me (with a bit of help on the internet for some parts of the code)
